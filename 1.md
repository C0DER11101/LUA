A multiline comment is written like this:
```lua

--[[
this is a multiline comment
]]
```

The strings are pretty much like those of Python's, it doesnot matter whether you write the string withing double quotes or single quotes.

You can print multiple outputs using the `,` operator!

```lua
print("hello", "world");
```

This will print `hello &nbsp; &nbsp; world` notice that there is a space between `hello` and `world` to remove that space we use `..`.
Example:

```lua
print("hello ".."world");
```

Output: `hello world`

You can also explicitly include a space, like this:

```lua
print("hello".." ".."world");
```
Output: `hello world`
